              <p>
                Hello! I'm Furqaabn Ahmed Shareef, a 12th-grade student with an insatiable curiosity for 
                technology and innovation. Currently, I'm immersing myself in the fascinating fields of 
                Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence, learning new skills every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey into tech started with a simple curiosity about how computers work, which quickly 
                evolved into a passion for programming and AI. From building my first "Hello World" program 
                to experimenting with machine learning models, every step has been an exciting adventure. 
                I believe that AI and IT are not just subjects to studyâ€”they're tools to create meaningful 
                solutions that can make a real difference in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a student, I'm constantly balancing academics with self-directed learning through online 
                courses, coding challenges, and personal projects. I'm particularly fascinated by how AI can 
                solve complex problems and how modern web technologies can create seamless user experiences. 
                My goal is to become a skilled developer and AI engineer who can bridge the gap between 
                cutting-edge technology and practical applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy reading tech blogs, watching AI tutorials, exploring 
                new programming languages, and thinking about how technology will shape our future. I'm always 
                eager to learn, collaborate, and take on new challenges that push me beyond my comfort zone.
              </p>
